	// Java is nearly 100% object oriented language
	// In java,its not possible to make a function which is not a member of any class(as we do in C++)
	

	// First program in java
	

	public class HelloWorld{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	System.out.print("Hello World");
	}
	}//do not put semicolon here
