// Access Modifilers in java
// java supports four categories of accessibility value.
// private,protected,public and default.
// modifiers can be used for class,member variables and member functions.

// with class
// for outer class, there can be two possibilities ,either class in a public class or just a class which means its of default type.
// for inner class any amoung four access modifiers can be used.


// Remember
// there can be only one public class in a single file.
// the name of java file must be the same as the name of public class.
// only public class can be accessed directly from outside the package.


// Member varibles and function
// when member of the class are private they can accessed from outside the class body.
// they are meant to be accessed from the same class in which they are declared.
// when members are protected ,they can be accessed from any class of the same package and child class from other package.
// when member are public they are accessible from any class of any package.
// when members are default,they are accessible only from the class of the package.
